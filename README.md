### Functional Programming and Lists ⚙️

Explore foundational functional programming concepts by manipulating and processing lists in Scala. Exercises include:

- Implementing custom list operations (e.g., map, filter, reduce).
- Understanding immutability and recursion.
- Practicing list comprehensions.

---

### Higher-Order Functions 🔥

Delve into the power of functions as first-class citizens. Key exercises include:

- Writing and applying functions that accept other functions as parameters.
- Using built-in higher-order functions (e.g., foldLeft, foldRight).
- Creating reusable, composable code snippets.

---

### Continuations ❓

Master continuations for advanced control flow:

- Understanding continuation-passing style (CPS).
- Converting recursive algorithms to CPS.
- Managing asynchronous computation using continuations.

---

### Datatypes and Pattern Matching 💖

Work with custom data types and pattern matching:

- Defining algebraic data types (ADTs).
- Using sealed traits and case classes.
- Employing pattern matching for clean, expressive code.

---

### Either and Error Handling 🚨

Handle errors gracefully using the `Either` type:

- Understanding the left (error) and right (success) semantics of `Either`.
- Writing safe and composable error-handling code.
- Converting between `Option` and `Either` where applicable.

---

### Trees and Recursion 🌲

Manipulate tree structures and practice recursive thinking:

- Implementing binary trees and traversal algorithms (inorder, preorder, postorder).
- Using recursion for problem-solving on hierarchical data.
- Balancing and optimizing tree-based operations.

---

### Parameterized Types 💫

Learn about Scala's type system and generics:

- Creating generic classes and methods.
- Understanding covariance and contravariance.
- Building reusable components using parameterized types.

---

### State and Side Effects 📦

Explore managing state in a functional way:

- Using the `State` monad to encapsulate mutable state.
- Building pipelines for state transformation.
- Minimizing and controlling side effects in programs.
